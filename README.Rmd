# readmat

<!-- badges: start -->

Readmat requires  a full license and installation of Matlab^{(R)} if you don't have this then the `R.matlab` package is much more suitable. The only goal of this package is to provide a potentially faster approach, especially when dealing with large matrices.

This package is definitely under development!

## Benchmark

A data cub of `r dim(readmat::read_mat(readmat::get_matlab("num-large-cube.mat")))`.

```{r bench}
# powered by bench::mark()
knitr::kable(readmat:::bm)
```
```


## Installation

You can install the development version of readmat from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartinSchobben/readmat")
```
