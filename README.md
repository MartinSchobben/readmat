# readmat

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Readmat requires a full license and installation of Matlab^{(R)} if you
donâ€™t have this then the `R.matlab` package is much more suitable. The
only goal of this package is to provide a potentially faster approach,
especially when dealing with large matrices.

This package is definitely under development!

## Benchmark

You can install the development version of readmat from
