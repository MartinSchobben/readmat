# readmat

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Readmat requires a full license and installation of Matlab^{(R)} if you
donâ€™t have this then the `R.matlab` package is much more suitable. The
only goal of this package is to provide a potentially faster approach,
especially when dealing with large matrices.

This package is definitely under development!

## Benchmark

A data cub of 400, 400, 400.

``` r
# powered by bench::mark()
knitr::kable(readmat:::bm)
```

|      min |  median |  itr/sec | mem_alloc | gc/sec | n_itr | n_gc | total_time |
